        Hey girl, I know you're feeling angry and I'm sorry that you're feeling that way. I know that you don't like to talk to
        me when you feel like that and it's probably likely that it was me that made you feel like that. The playlist below is going to 
        be on every page and hopefully you like these songs. I chose them because we've listened to them together or they remind me of
        you. I know that it feels like everything sucks but I'm here for you, even if I'm not actually there you'll always have access to
        this website. When you're mad at me, I hope that this website helps with that too. (There's a little surprise button here for you, make sure to press it)
